log4javascript
==============

http://log4javascript.org

It contains the log4javascript lib prepared to be used with npm.

Unfortunately, the npm package 1.4.15 still contains log4javascript 1.4.13.
It was necessary to increase the version since the new package contains also TypeScript definitions.
